          <span class="lead"><strong>The line is made up of an infinite number of points;</strong></span>the
          plane of an infinite number of lines; the volume of an infinite
          number of planes; the hypervolume of an infinite number of
          volumes. No, unquestionably this is not — more geometrico
          — the best way of beginning my story. To claim that is it true
          is nowadays the convention of every made-up story. <br><strong>Mine,
          however, is true.</strong> <br><br>

          I live alone in a fourth-floor apartment on
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenida_Belgrano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Belgrano Street</a>,
          in Buenos Aires. Late one evening, a few months back, I
          heard a knock at my door. I opened it and a stranger stood
          there. He was a tall man, with nondescript features — or
          perhaps it was my myopia that made them seem that way.
          Dressed in gray and carrying a gray suitcase in his hand, he
          had an unassuming look about him. I saw at once that he
          was a foreigner. At first, he struck me as old; only later did I
          realize that I had been misled by his thin blond hair, which
          was, in a Scandinavian sort of way, almost white. During the
          course of our conversation, which was not to last an hour, I
          found out that he came from the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkney" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Orkneys</a>.
          I invited him in, pointing to a chair. He paused awhile
          before speaking. A kind of gloom emanated from him — as it
          does now from me. <br><br>

          <span class="quote">"I sell Bibles," he said.</span> <br><br>

          Somewhat pedantically, I replied, "In this house are
          several English Bibles, including the first - John Wicliffe's. I
          also have Cipriano de Valera's, Luther's — which, from a
          literary viewpoint, is the worst — and a Latin copy of the
          Vulgate. As you see, it's not exactly Bibles I stand in need
          of." <br><br>

          After a few moments of silence, he said, "I don't only sell
          Bibles. I can show you a holy book I came across on the
          outskirts of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Bikaner</a>.
          It may interest you." <br><br>

          He opened the suitcase and laid the book on a table. It
          was an octavo volume, bound in cloth. There was no doubt
          that it had passed through many hands. Examining it, I was
          surprised by its unusual weight. On the spine were the words
          "Holy Writ" and, below them, "Bombay." <br><br>

          "Nineteenth century, probably," I remarked. <br>
          "I don't know," he said. "I've never found out." <br><br>

          I opened the book at random. The script was strange to
          me. The pages, which were worn and typographically poor,
          were laid out in a double column, as in a Bible. The text was
          closely printed, and it was ordered in versicles. In the upper
          corners of the pages were Arabic numbers. I noticed that one
          left-hand page bore the number (let us say) 40,514 and the
          facing right-hand page 999. I turned the leaf; it was
          numbered with eight digits. It also bore a small illustration,
          like the kind used in dictionaries — an anchor drawn with
          pen and ink, as if by a schoolboy's clumsy hand. <br><br>

          It was at this point that the stranger said, <br>

          <span class="quote">"Look at the illustration closely. You'll never see it again."</span>
          <br><br>

          I noted my place and closed the book. At once, I
          reopened it. Page by page, in vain, I looked for the
          illustration of the anchor. "It seems to be a version of
          Scriptures in some Indian language, is it not?" I said to hide
          my dismay. <br><br>

          "No," he replied. Then, as if confiding a secret, he
          lowered his voice. "I acquired the book in a town out on the
          plain in exchange for a handful of rupees and a Bible. Its
          owner did not know how to read. I suspect that he saw the
          Book of Books as a talisman. He was of the lowest caste;
          nobody but other untouchables could tread his shadow
          without contamination. He told me his book was called the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Sand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Book of Sand</a>,
          because neither the book nor the sand has
          any beginning or end." <br><br>

          The stranger asked me to find the first page.
          I laid my left hand on the cover and, trying to put my
          thumb on the flyleaf, I opened the book. It was useless.
          Every time I tried, a number of pages came between the
          cover and my thumb. It was as if they kept growing from the
          book. <br><br>

          <span class="quote">"Now find the last page."</span> <br><br>

          Again I failed. In a voice that was not mine, I barely
          managed to stammer, <br>
          <span class="quote">"This can't be."</span> <br><br>

          Still speaking in a low voice, the stranger said, <strong>"It can't be, but it is."</strong> The number of pages in this book is no more or
          less than infinite. None is the first page, none the last. I don't
          know why they're numbered in this arbitrary way. Perhaps to
          suggest that the terms of an infinite series admit any
          number." <br><br>

          Then, as if he were thinking aloud, he said, <br><strong>
"If space is infinite, we may be at any point in space.
If time is infinite, we may be at any point in time."
</strong><br><br>

          His speculations irritated me. "You are religious, no
          doubt?" I asked him. <br><br>

          "Yes, I'm a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Presbyterian</a>.
          My conscience is clear. I am
          reasonably sure of not having cheated the native when I
          gave him the Word of God in exchange for his devilish book."
          <br><br>

          I assured him that he had nothing to reproach himself for,
          and I asked if he were just passing through this part of the
          world. He replied that he planned to return to his country in a
          few days. It was then that I learned that he was a Scot from
          the Orkney Islands. I told him I had a great personal affection
          for Scotland, through my love of Stevenson and Hume.
          <br><br>

          "You mean Stevenson and Robbie Burns," he corrected.
          While we spoke, I kept exploring the infinite book. With
          feigned indifference, I asked, "Do you intend to offer this
          curiosity to the British Museum?" <br><br>

          "No. I'm offering it to you," he said, and he stipulated a
          rather high sum for the book. <br><br>

          I answered, in all truthfulness, that such a sum was out of
          my reach, and I began thinking. After a minute or two, I came
          up with a scheme. <br><br>

          <span class="quote">"I propose a swap,"</span> I said. "You got this book for a
          handful of rupees and a copy of the Bible. I'll offer you the
          amount of my pension check, which I've just collected, and
          my black-letter Wicliffe Bible. I inherited it from my
          ancestors." <br><br>

          <span class="quote">"A black-letter Wicliffe!"</span> he murmured. <br><br>

          I went to my bedroom and brought him the money and
          the book. He turned the leaves and studied the title page
          with all the fervor of a true bibliophile. <br><br>

          <span class="quote">"It's a deal,"</span> he said. <br><br>

          It amazed me that he did not haggle. Only later was I to
          realize that he had entered my house with his mind made up
          to sell the book. Without counting the money, he put it away.
          We talked about India, about Orkney, and about the
          Norwegian jarls who once ruled it. It was night when the man
          left. I have not seen him again, nor do I know his name.
          <br><br>

          I thought of keeping the Book of Sand in the space left on
          the shelf by the Wiclif, but in the end I decided to hide it
          behind the volumes of a broken set of The Thousand and
          One Nights. I went to bed and did not sleep. At three or four
          in the morning, I turned on the light. I got down the
          impossible book and leafed through its pages. On one of
          them I saw engraved a mask. The upper corner of the page
          carried a number, which I no longer recall, elevated to the
          ninth power. <br><br>

          I showed no one my treasure. To the luck of owning it
          was added the fear of having it stolen, and then the
          misgiving that it might not truly be infinite. These twin
          preoccupations intensified my old misanthropy. I had only a
          few friends left; I now stopped seeing even them. <strong>A prisoner
          of the book, I almost never went out anymore. </strong>After studying
          its frayed spine and covers with a magnifying glass, I
          rejected the possibility of a contrivance of any sort. The small
          illustrations, I verified, came two thousand pages apart. I set
          about listing them alphabetically in a notebook, which I was
          not long in filling up. Never once was an illustration repeated.
          At night, in the meager intervals my insomnia granted, I
          dreamed of the book. <br><br>

          <strong>Summer came and went, and I realized that the book was monstrous.</strong>
          What good did it do me to think that I, who
          looked upon the volume with my eyes, who held it in my
          hands, was any less monstrous? I felt that the book was a
          nightmarish object, an obscene thing that affronted and
          tainted reality itself. <br><br>

          I thought of fire, but I feared that the burning of an infinite
          book might likewise prove infinite and suffocate the planet
          with smoke. Somewhere I recalled reading that the best
          place to hide a leaf is in a forest. Before retirement, I worked
          on Mexico Street, at the Argentine National Library, which
          contains nine hundred thousand volumes. I knew that to the
          right of the entrance a curved staircase leads down into the
          basement, where books and maps and periodicals are kept.
          One day I went there and, slipping past a member of the staff
          and trying not to notice at what height or distance from the
          door, I lost the Book of Sand on one of the basement's musty
          shelves.
